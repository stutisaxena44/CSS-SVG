# SVG Practice File 🎨

This project is a basic **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) practice page** built using **HTML and CSS**. It demonstrates different SVG shapes, paths, text, gradients, and animations to understand how SVG works inside a web page.

## 📁 Project Structure
- Single HTML file
- Inline CSS for styling
- Multiple SVG elements showcasing different concepts

## 🧩 SVG Elements Used

- **Circle with Text**  
  Displays a circle with centered text inside it.

- **Rectangle**  
  A simple rectangle shape using `<rect>`.

- **Line**  
  Straight line created using the `<line>` element.

- **Polygon**  
  A triangle made using the `<polygon>` element.

- **Bezier Curve (Path)**  
  Curved line created using `<path>` with quadratic Bézier curves.

- **Animated Circle (Position Animation)**  
  Circle moves horizontally using the `<animate>` tag.

- **Animated Rectangle (Color Animation)**  
  Rectangle changes colors continuously.

- **Scale Animation**  
  Circle grows and shrinks using `<animateTransform>`.

- **Text Animation**  
  Text fades in and out using opacity animation.

- **Linear Gradient**  
  Rectangle filled with a linear gradient using `<defs>` and `<linearGradient>`.

- **Heart Shape (Path Animation)**  
  Custom heart shape made using cubic Bézier curves with opacity animation.

## ✨ Concepts Demonstrated

- SVG basic shapes
- SVG text positioning
- SVG paths and curves
- SVG animations (`animate`, `animateTransform`)
- Gradients in SVG
- Inline SVG styling
- SVG inside HTML

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- SVG

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Copy the HTML code into a `.html` file  
2. Open the file in any modern web browser  
3. Observe different SVG shapes and animations in action

## 🎯 Purpose

This file is created for **learning and practicing SVG fundamentals**, animations, and how SVG integrates with HTML.
